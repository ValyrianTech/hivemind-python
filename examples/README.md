## Usage

Each example can be run independently. Before running, make sure to:

1. Install the hivemind-python package
2. Replace placeholder values (addresses, signatures) with real ones
3. Have IPFS running locally or specify your IPFS gateway

Example:
```bash
python basic_voting.py
```

## Note

These examples are for demonstration purposes. In a production environment, you should:

1. Properly handle signatures and addresses
2. Implement proper error handling
3. Use secure methods for managing private keys
4. Consider adding logging and monitoring
5. Implement proper access controls
